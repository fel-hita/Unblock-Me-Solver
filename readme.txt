Unblock-me solving algorithm using C++ and SDL library.

Algorithm approach : 
The solver uses both BFS and DFS algorithms to solve the given initial board states.

Note :
The makefile uses the local lib files located inside the lib/ folder.
You should either use the original sdl files of your framework by linking them via the command line or copy manually the needed lib files and replace them inside the lib folder.
