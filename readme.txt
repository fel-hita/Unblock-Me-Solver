Unblock-me solving algorithm using C++ and SDL library.

Algorithm approach : 
The solver uses both BFS and DFS algorithms to solve the given initial board states.
The original algorithm was first implemented by Karakanb (https://github.com/karakanb), We improved and fixed some minor error and integrated SDL library.

Note :
The makefile uses the local lib files located inside the lib/ folder.
You should either use the original sdl files of your framework or copy manually the needed lib files and replace them inside the lib folder.
