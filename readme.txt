Unblock-me solving algorithm using C++ and SDL library.

Algorithm approach : 
The solver uses both BFS and DFS algorithms to solve the given initial board states.
The original algorithm was first implemented by Karakanb (https://github.com/karakanb), We improved and fixed some minor error and integrated SDL library.

Note :
The algorithm uses the local lib files located inside the lib folder,
To fix this you should either use the original sdl files of your framework or copy manually the needed lib files and replace them inside the lib folder.
